This is SieFS - a virtual filesystem for accessing Siemens
mobile phones' memory (flexmem or MultiMediaCard) from
Linux. Now you can mount your phone (by datacable or IRDA)
and work with it like with any other removable storage.

SieFS was tested on
- S45, ME45, SL45
- SL55, M55, MC60
- CX65, M65, C65, S65

It should work also on C55/M50/MT50 models with enabled
serial interface (developer pack). There should not be any
problems with other new Siemens phones.

SieFS consists of filesystem module (siefs), command-line
utility (slink) and voice memo converter (vmo2wav).

SieFS depends on Filesystem in USErspace (FUSE) package.
Download it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse . 


The syntax of mount command is:

	mount -t siefs [-o options] COMM_DEVICE MOUNT_DIR

COMM_DEVICE is /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1... for COM cables, or
/dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1... for USB cables.

Options are:

	baudrate=<value>	set communication speed to value.
				Supported values are 9600, 19200,
				38400, 57600, 115200. By default,
				115200 is used. You can try higher
				speeds (230400 and 460800). Special
				value 0 means no speed changing.
				Note that SL45 doesn't support this
				option.
	uid=<value>
	gid=<value>
	umask=<value>		set user ID, group ID and
				umask value for mounted
				files. See man mount(8)

	iocharset=<charset>	use specified charset for filename
				conversion. Default is UTF8.

	nohide			do not hide 'telecom' directory.
				'telecom' is a virtual directory
				that contains your address book
				records and calendar events.
				By default, it is not shown, but
				anyway you can cd into it. 
				Not all phones have this directory.

	device=<device>		set communication device. May be
				useful in fstab (first parameter
				in fstab in this case will be
				/proc/fs/fuse/dev).

You can enter mount command when your mobile is not connected to PC.
Also you can connect and disconnect it at any time without need to
remount filesystem.

For automatic mounting, add something like this to your /etc/fstab:

 /proc/fs/fuse/dev   /mnt/mobile   siefs   device=/dev/ttyS0   0 0


slink is an utility for working with phone's memory without mounting.
Type `slink -h' to view all supported commands.

vmo2wav is a converter of voice memo (dictaphone) records to wav format.
